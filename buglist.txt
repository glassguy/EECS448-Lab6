Things that don't work:
    isEmpty()
    addBack()
    removeBack()
    removeFront()

Reasoning:
    isEmpty() always returns that the list is empty regardless whether it is or not.
    addBack() doesn't place the correct values in the right location.
    removeBack() doesn't decrement size and seems to only return false, this might partly be due to some kind of dependence on isEmpty(). Also doesn't seem to remove values correctly.
    removeFront() doesn't decrement size and seems to only return false, this might partly be due to some kind of dependence on isEmpty(), similar to removeBack(). Also doesn't seem to remove values correctly.
